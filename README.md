Rock Paper Scissors - TOP Project

3/9/24
Starting the project optimistically. I created the first function without any issues, so it looks like everything I learned prior to TOP is coming back, which is encouraging.

Finished the project. I had a bit of trouble with scope, so I had to mess around with that and figure it out. I did step away from everything for a few days, and when I cam back to it, it made a lot more sense. I think I initially studied too much on the 9th and when I got to the project, my brain was fried, so nothing was coming together like I planned. Anyway, good learning experience, and now I know the importance of taking breaks, at least.
Admittedly, my code is probably not pretty, and I probably could have broken down the playGame() function into more than one, but for now, it wil do. It works as intended, and I think thats the main point for smaller programs like this.
